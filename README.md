# Responsive Chat Application

A fully responsive chat interface built using **React**, **Vite**, **Material-UI (MUI)**, and **Redux Toolkit**. This project implements a simple chat UI where users can send and receive messages, with state management provided by Redux Toolkit.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The chat interface adjusts to various screen sizes and is centered on the screen for an optimal user experience.
- **Message Input and Send**: Users can type messages and send them via a button.
- **Chat Display**: Messages are displayed in a scrollable chat window with timestamps for each message.
- **Auto-Scroll**: The chat window scrolls automatically to the latest message.
- **Simulated Message Reception**: Messages are simulated after a delay to demonstrate real-time chat functionality.
- **State Management**: Managed using Redux Toolkit, ensuring clean and organized state for messages and user information.
- **Material-UI Components**: Styled using MUI components for a modern, consistent UI.




## Tech Stack

- **React 18**: Used for building the UI and managing the component lifecycle.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool used to bundle and run the project.
- **Material-UI (MUI)**: For consistent and responsive UI components.
- **Redux Toolkit**: For state management, handling chat messages and user data.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core language for all functionality.
